# app-profile-recommendation
## Summary
This repository looks at app data from 10,000 Android apps and 7,000 iOS apps to solve the following questions:

1. What genres and categories of apps generate the highest average installs and users in both the Google and Apple app stores?
2. What genres and categories of apps generate the highest average user ratings in both the Google and Apple app stores?

## Scope
We will only be looking at free-to-download, English-language apps.

## Assumptions
1. The number of installs and users an app has is directly correlated to ad-revenue generated by the app.
Under this assumption, the first question we are answering can be rephrased as: What genres and categories of apps generate the most ad-revenue in both the Google and Apple app stores?
2. The user rating for an app is directly correlated to the likelihood the user spends money on in-app purchases and/or subscriptions.
Under this assumption, the second question we are answering can be rephrased as: What genres and categories of apps are the most likely to generate in-app purchases and paid subscriptions from its users.

## Topics Covered
1. Data collection and parsing from CSV files using Python.
2. Data cleaning:
    a. Browsing forums to see if data has any mistakes.
    b. Finding and handling duplicate data.
    c. Filtering out data that does not fall under our scope (free-to-download, English-language).
3. Basic data analysis using frequency tables.
